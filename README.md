Minecraft Enchanced Datapack
Im making a datapack for my Server and thought I could update it on github as well just in case and for feedback.
Note that my code is VERY messy and will only clean it up once im really done with something.

Currently adds:
3 New Attacks for the Enderdragon

API for Motion

API for enchantments (But selfmade so its doodoo)

1 Enchantment
 - Double jump
 
1 Custom "potion" Effect
 - Bleeding (Deals DOT (damage over time) based on the amount of damage taken)
